## Background
Chipping away at my homework backlog.

## File information
My work each of the exercises - PyBank and PyPoll - is located in folders with the corresponding names. 
Run the main.py script to see my output!
The output will print to the terminal and also be saved in a file called analysis.txt - this file will be located in the same directory as main.py

## My thoughts
Good exercise for reading csv files, working with data structures, and writing to text files using python. 
I think it was really good to go back and work with some python data structures like dictionaries - it's easy to forget some of the ways to work with them!
